ccod
------------------------------------------
C Cod allows for a C,C++,ObjC source file to be 'Compiled on Demand' 
prior to being executed. The source files are compiled and executed on 
the fly. This allows for C,C++,ObjC to be treated like a scripting 
language. But, C Cod does not actually do the compiling. Rather it acts 
as a front-end and uses the the C compiler that is installed on the 
computer. This is most often the GNU C Compiler, and therefore designed 
to be used with GCC.

Runtime requirements:
